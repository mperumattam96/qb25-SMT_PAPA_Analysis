# Analyzing Single-Molecule Tracking Data Obtained by PAPA in Live Cells

## Description
Single-molecule tracking (SMT) using proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) in live cells generates vast data sets. The amount of data created through these SMT experiments immediately doubles when working with multiple channels on a microscope. Moreover, this method requires the use of a direct reactivation control in order to normalize the number of proximity activated molecules against the total number of molecules of the given type (e.g., a particular proteinâ€”in this case BRD4). As such, we propose creating a Python script that would allow for plotting of localization number as a function of frame number. That is, a program that would permit relating the number of single-molecule trajectories to the live imaging frame number. This script could then be used for the aforementioned normalization.

## Goals
Main goal: Using a Python script, read in the CSV file obtained from SMT data and tabulate the number of localizations per frame. We will begin with a CSV file that is based on segmentation from a single cell, and focus on columns x, y, frame, and trajectory.  
Stretch Goal 1: Adding onto goal one, factor in background from spontaneous activation. We will extrapolate spontaneous activation after the green light pulse and perform background subtraction.  
Stretch Goal 2: We will look to see if PAPA signal correlates to other properties in the cell. These other properties come from cell segmentation data.
